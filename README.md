If Tom has 3 more apples than Jerry and Jerry has 5 apples, how many apples does Tom have?

Let $A$ be the number of apples Tom has, $J$ be the number of apples Jerry has, and $B$ be the number of apples Bob has.
We are given that Tom has 3 more apples than Jerry, so $A = J + 3$.
We are also given that Jerry has 5 apples, so $J = 5$.
Substituting $J = 5$ into the equation $A = J + 3$, we get $A = 5 + 3 = 8$.
So Tom has 8 apples.
We are asked to find how many apples Tom has. We are given that Tom has 3 more apples than Jerry, and Jerry has 5 apples.
So, Tom has $5 + 3 = 8$ apples.
The total number of apples is $A + J + B = 8 + 5 + B = 13 + B$.
We want to find $A$.
Since $A = J + 3$ and $J = 5$, we have $A = 5 + 3 = 8$.
Therefore, Tom has 8 apples.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{8}$

If Tom has 3 more apples than Jerry and Jerry has 5 apples, how many apples does Tom have?

Let $A$ be the number of apples Tom has, $J$ be the number of apples Jerry has, and $R$ be the total number of apples. We are given that Jerry has 5 apples, so $J=5$. Tom has 3 more apples than Jerry, so $A = J + 3$.
We can find the number of apples Tom has by substituting $J=5$ into the equation $A = J+3$:
$A = 5+3 = 8$.
So Tom has 8 apples.
The total number of apples is $R = A + J + \text{other apples}$.
We are given that Jerry has 5 apples, so $J=5$. Tom has 3 more apples than Jerry, so $A = J+3 = 5+3 = 8$.
The total number of apples is $R = A+J+R_{other} = 8+5+R_{other} = 13+R_{other}$.
We are given that Jerry has 5 apples, so $J=5$.
Tom has 3 more apples than Jerry, so $A = J+3 = 5+3 = 8$.
The total number of apples Tom has is 8.
The total number of apples is $T+J+R = 8+5+R = 13+R$.

We are given that Jerry has 5 apples.
Tom has 3 more apples than Jerry, so Tom has $5+3=8$ apples.
Therefore, Tom has 8 apples.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{8}$
